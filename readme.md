# What are the Requests & Limits?

When Kubernetes clusters build pods in an apartment building. Each (pod) requires specific resources like CPU and memory to function:

 

Requests: This is the minimum amount of resources a pod needs to operate smoothly. Think of it as a guaranteed reservation for the pod.

Limits: This is the maximum amount of resources a pod can use. It acts as a safety cap to prevent any pod from consuming more than its fair share and disrupting others.

Why are Requests & Limits Important?

Resource Control: By setting limits, you prevent a single pod from monopolizing resources, which can lead to issues like out-of-memory (OOM) kills or CPU starvation. ☠️ Why OOM can be a good thing? Because it kills the pod; otherwise, the container would have consumed all the memory and could kill the node. Killing the pod is a better option than killing a node itself.

Predictability: Requests help the scheduler allocate resources efficiently and ensure pods have the necessary resources to run effectively.

Exploring Resource Management:

# Exceeding Available Memory:
A pod requesting more memory than is available will be killed due to an OOM (Out of Memory) error.
